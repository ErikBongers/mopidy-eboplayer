Playlists
===========
1. View
--------
* Add edit button to list button bar.

2. Edit
---------
* Edit 'live', that is, show the results in real time.
* allow AND and OR filters.

3. Filter
----------
A playlist filter is like a browse filter
  - search text + type buttons.

* Create view for playlists
   > fetch expanded tracks
   > Similar to album view:
     > same buttons (to get started)
     > no image (for now?)
       > or a set of images behind each other?
       > clicking is browsing?
         > how about going to the album?

* dblclick on album track > play

What do I need?
- Build playlists
  > in Browse, when clicking on a playlist - open the playlist page.
    > does a playlist item have a user defined name?

* refresh dead connection on browser "wake up"

  > or this alternative of window blur/focus
    >>> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13798516/javascript-event-for-mobile-browser-re-launch-or-device-wake

* Browse: dbllick on radio starts it and goes to Now Playing.
  > Animated visual feedback of dblclick:
    > Fade in and out the active bkg color of play bar.

* Set active track in page title.

* Navigating Browse/Now playing/Album
  > Now playing shows title of track and playlist.
  > Browse shows filters + album view.
  > Album view shows...well, the album (same view as in browse)
  * Navigation:
    - Image next to play bar:
      > goto Now Playing
    - Right corner magnifier:
      > goto Browse
      > you can go back because the maginfier changes into album.
      > you can also go back via play bar
    - Click on album in in Now Playing:
      > goto Album


* Brows: click on album:
  > show album view UNDER search fields!!!
  > show tracks under album image.
  > add tabs to switch between tracks/info/meta
    > show album image a bit smaller to indicate that this is not the "now playing" view.
      > this means, don't use big view compoonent or split it up!!!


* Big view of current track:
  > show album title on top of track name.
  > clicking art shows...
    > tabs!
      - tracks
      - info
        > artists, composersyear, etc...
        > info text found online?
      - meta
        > genre
        > file location?
        > uri
        > ...


* Browse: click on album:
  > goto album
  > deepest dive thus is: playlist > album > track? Or do playlists not contain albums?

* show an info button next to filter buttons.
  > show info block with a "remove info button" button. When pressing, inform user this can be changed in settings.

* Show tracklist in timeline.


Browse
======
- a search field
  > pre-filled with last search.
- search results
- filter buttons:
  > a row of buttons for each of the following:
    - albums: square with disc sticking out?
    - artists: torso silhouette?
    - tracks: lines?
    - streams/radio: radio icon or antenna? (wifi logo-like)
    - files: file icon
    - playlists: stacked page of lines > tracks icon, but stacked.
    - history: history icon: curled up lines.
    - radio: radio icon?
    - genre: veritas or flower icon.
      > a circle, a square and a triangle?
      > Arrows pointing in different directions?
        > different shapes?

* have image view and a list view.
  > have a wall-of-albums,
    > perhaps even random?
    > perhaps 3 views: list, album (/w title) and wall?
* image views are configurable
  > number of columns.
  > spacing configurable?
* buttons to filter search results for albums, artists and tracks.
* when on a track, allow to browse upward into album, artist, playlists.

Browse: user behaviour:
  > cursor immediately in search field,, which is the header field?
    > could give conflict with error messages.
  > last search is prefilled.
  > submit search per key-stroke.
    > if not fast enough: local cache.
  > how to go back?
    > the browse icon changes in a mini album.

 Buttons (ellipsis), double click, long click
 =============================================
 * These can be set via settings.
   > default is buttons=visible.
* Single click is selection by default.
* Double click is play.
* Long click is same as button.

Queue
======
When queue goes to the next track, these events occur:
  - volume_changed
  - track_playback_ended -> time_positin, tl_Track
  - playback_state_changed -> playing
  - track_playback_started -> TlTrack


* Iris player seems to have a way to get all the tracks really fast.
  > but cannot add radio strams (with names) to playlists.
  > also only possible to add a track to a list via the "now playing" screen.


* Track line: ellipsis button:
  - Play
  - Details
    > shows artist, album and tracklists this track belongs to.

* Webcomponent with template: https://css-tricks.com/web-components-are-easier-than-you-think/

* Implement start screen.
  > if no current track:
    > get history.
      > if none: (probably!)
        > show Browser in that case.
      > if found, display it, positioned at last track.
  > if current track:
    > it will probably be shown automatically, but also start playing automatically...which may not be a bad thing...

* when a new track is played (default click on play button), these commands are sent:
  - play is stopped. (needed? or automatically done when clearinngg the tracklist?)
  - the tracklist is cleared.
  - new track is added to the tracklist
  - tracklist filter is cleared.
  >> event:tracklistchanged is sent.
  > that's it!
    > query:
      - tracklist
      - current track (TLtrack

Layout
=========

Start screen always last track/stream.
  > what if there is no last track?
  > A user will want to select something to play.
    > Goto Search and show history, if present.
  > All lists will highlight the active (if any) track/album,...
When playing a track of an album, artist, playlist:
  > user shoud be able to go to the list.
  > if the window is long (or wide) enough, show the list, centered around the active track.
  > user can hide this list to have a cleaner view.
    > need a button to show the list.
      > icon? a hamburger with 4 lines and a brighter line in the middle?

 When a track is playing, a mini-player should be displayed at the bottom (or top?).
 Volume, plus a mute button should always be visible.
 Playback options should be under a menu, as they are not often used.

Per track or list:
   > highlight the active one.
   > a play button to immediately start playing.
   > a menu for all the other actions.

Search button is entrypoint to all lists of tracks
  - history (this one on top or even expanded, if present)
  - streams
  - files
  - albums
  - artists

Have a stream title history as well. Per radio station?
Stream title history has max of 100 items?

* On stream start, and extension start: clear history or at least write a dummy history block:
      ---
      Starting stream xxx
      ---
  > not needed on extension start, if on stream start creates a separator.

* Replace Home pane with last played..
  > perhaps merge this pane with Now Playing?
* get rid of jQuery
* flex or grid?
* setVolume(): use a curved function for better low volume control.
  > User option?
  > For both input and output in range [0..100]:
    > Quadratic: (x*x)/100
    > Cubic: (x*x*x)/10000


* "Streams" are mopidy playlists.
  > has 2 fields: name and uri
  > if uri starts with file: or http:, a different backend is triggered.
