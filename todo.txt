MVC...or whataver
==================
* Model contains current state.
* Controller
  > receives messages from WebSocket and sets the model.
    > the model informs it's listeners (Views).
  > has commands to change data.
    > changes are sent to WebSocket, NOT to the model directly!
* Views
  > listen to model events.
  > send commands to the controller.
* Encapsulation
  > Only the controller can set the model.
  > Views can only read ( get...() ) the model.
  > Views can only change data through the commands.


Layout
=========

Start screen always last track/stream.
Menu contains: Queue, Playlists.
Browse is a button within Queue and Playlist(s).
Browse shows files, streams and playlists.
Search is an option within browse or a field on top?




* On stream start, and extension start: clear history or at least write a dummy history block:
      ---
      Starting stream xxx
      ---
  > not needed on extension start, if on stream start creates a separator.

* Replace Home pane with last played..
  > perhaps merge this pane with Now Playing?
* get rid of jQuery
* flex or grid?
* setVolume(): use a curved function for better low volume control.
  > User option?
  > For both input and output in range [0..100]:
    > Quadratic: (x*x)/100
    > Cubic: (x*x*x)/10000


* "Streams" are mopidy playlists.
  > has 2 fields: name and uri
  > if uri starts with file: or http:, a different backend is triggered.
