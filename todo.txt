* Separete model view controller.
  > model:

Build indexedDb
===============
* Tracks are the lowest level.
  > contain link to the album uri, if any.
* Albums contain tracks.
  > possibly of multiple artists.
* Artists 'contain'
  - albums
  - tracks
  - genres?
* Genres contain
  - albums
  - tracks

* data sources:
  - local files : //local:
  - files : //file:
  - urls for streams. : //http, etc...

* commands for database:
  - browse
    > find directory structure
    > for every backend root
  - search
    > where `field` contains...
      > e.g. `artist` = ['ikke', 'gij']
      > special field `any` to search all fields.
  - distinct: DO NOT USE
  > Iris uses this url to get all artists:
    : local:directory?type=artist&role=albumartist
      > after removing the role, all the artists are shown.


* Prepare list of items to browse.
  > From what sources?
    > Mopidy has:
      - history
      - library: backends
      - playlists
      -
    > Local files: this is a http protocol?
      > any source or protocol!
    > Other extensions?
      > Url protocols?
        > unlikely: too technical. Perhaps configure in settings.

Browse
======
- a search field
  > pre-filled with last search.
- search results
- filter buttons:
  > a row of buttons for each of the following:
    - albums: square with disc sticking out?
    - artists: torso silhouette?
    - tracks: lines?
    - streams/radio: radio icon or antenna? (wifi logo-like)
    - files: file icon
    - playlists: stacked page of lines > tracks icon, but stacked.
    - history: history icon: curled up lines.
    - radio: radio icon?
    - genre: veritas or flower icon.
      > a circle, a square and a triangle?
      > Arrows pointing in different directions?
        > different shapes?

* have image view and a list view.
  > have a wall-of-albums,
    > perhaps even random?
    > perhaps 3 views: list, album (/w title) and wall?
* image views are configurable
  > number of columns.
  > spacing configurable?
* buttons to filter search results for albums, artists and tracks.
* when on a track, allow to browse upward into album, artist, playlists.

Browse: user behaviour:
  > cursor immediately in search field,, which is the header field?
    > could give conflict with error messages.
  > last search is prefilled.
  > submit search per key-stroke.
    > if not fast enough: local cache.
  > how to go back?
    > the browse icon changes in a mini album.

 Buttons (ellipsis), double click, long click
 =============================================
 * These can be set via settings.
   > default is buttons=visible.
* Single click is selection by default.
* Double click is play.
* Long click is same as button.

Queue
======
When queue goes to the next track, these events occur:
  - volume_changed
  - track_playback_ended -> time_positin, tl_Track
  - playback_state_changed -> playing
  - track_playback_started -> TlTrack


* Iris player seems to have a way to get all the tracks really fast.
  > but cannot add radio strams (with names) to playlists.
  > also only possible to add a track to a list via the "now playing" screen.


* Track line: ellipsis button:
  - Play
  - Details
    > shows artist, album and tracklists this track belongs to.

* Webcomponent with template: https://css-tricks.com/web-components-are-easier-than-you-think/

* Implement start screen.
  > if no current track:
    > get history.
      > if none: (probably!)
        > show Browser in that case.
      > if found, display it, positioned at last track.
  > if current track:
    > it will probably be shown automatically, but also start playing automatically...which may not be a bad thing...

* when a new track is played (default click on play button), these commands are sent:
  - play is stopped. (needed? or automatically done when clearinngg the tracklist?)
  - the tracklist is cleared.
  - new track is added to the tracklist
  - tracklist filter is cleared.
  >> event:tracklistchanged is sent.
  > that's it!
    > query:
      - tracklist
      - current track (TLtrack

Layout
=========

Start screen always last track/stream.
  > what if there is no last track?
  > A user will want to select something to play.
    > Goto Search and show history, if present.
  > All lists will highlight the active (if any) track/album,...
When playing a track of an album, artist, playlist:
  > user shoud be able to go to the list.
  > if the window is long (or wide) enough, show the list, centered around the active track.
  > user can hide this list to have a cleaner view.
    > need a button to show the list.
      > icon? a hamburger with 4 lines and a brighter line in the middle?

 When a track is playing, a mini-player should be displayed at the bottom (or top?).
 Volume, plus a mute button should always be visible.
 Playback options should be under a menu, as they are not often used.

Per track or list:
   > highlight the active one.
   > a play button to immediately start playing.
   > a menu for all the other actions.

Search button is entrypoint to all lists of tracks
  - history (this one on top or even expanded, if present)
  - streams
  - files
  - albums
  - artists

Have a stream title history as well. Per radio station?
Stream title history has max of 100 items?

* On stream start, and extension start: clear history or at least write a dummy history block:
      ---
      Starting stream xxx
      ---
  > not needed on extension start, if on stream start creates a separator.

* Replace Home pane with last played..
  > perhaps merge this pane with Now Playing?
* get rid of jQuery
* flex or grid?
* setVolume(): use a curved function for better low volume control.
  > User option?
  > For both input and output in range [0..100]:
    > Quadratic: (x*x)/100
    > Cubic: (x*x*x)/10000


* "Streams" are mopidy playlists.
  > has 2 fields: name and uri
  > if uri starts with file: or http:, a different backend is triggered.
